# screenGoldenMiner
The tradition Golden Miner is obsoleted, why not play the New Golden Miner with you desktop icon?


work on Windows10 64bit(maybe Windows7 can also be used?i'm not sure)

need PIL,pywin32

most windows10 computer use WorkerW window handle, but someone use Program Manager window handle, there have two version to use, if you can not find the handle with first version, maybe you can try another version

set screen resolution zoom 100% to get best experience
